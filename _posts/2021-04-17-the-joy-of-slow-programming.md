title: "The joy of slow programming"
---

I had a difficult relationship with side projects in the past. Basically I
could never get anywhere with them. Thanks to a set of techniques that I called "slow programming" I managed to develop side projects in a way that brings me joy. And this is the story that I'd like to share with you.

In the past when I was starting a new side project I'd try to fulfill these three goals:
1. build something meaningful that people can benefit from
2. use a cool new technology that I wanted to learn
3. make each commit perfect

As you may suspect, these three goals are really hard to fulfill at once. I'd usually give up at the stage of learning the new technology or setting up
the test environment. I didn't have any visible results at the beginning so I was not motivated to continue with the project. And a similar pattern would repeat for many different ideas.
