title: "Upgrading ActiveModelSerializers from 0.8 to 0.10"
---

ActiveModelSerializers is a popular solution in the Ruby / Rails community
and I even wrote
[an article about it](/blog/2014/03/02/json-api-with-rails-api-and-active-model-serializers/)
a few years ago. Recently I had a chance to cover
[upgrading ActiveModelSerializers from 0.8 to 0.10](https://liefery-it-legacy.github.io/blog/2017/11/07/upgrading-active-model-serializers-from-0-8-to-0-10.html)
on my company's blog. You should take a look!
