title: "Token authentication with Tiddle"

---

This post describes how to use [Tiddle](https://github.com/adamniedzielski/tiddle/) - gem for token authentication which I created. Tiddle is a Devise authentication strategy which supports **multiple tokens per user**.

Last updated: 30.10.2015

### Motivation

I needed token authentication strategy for Devise in JSON API application. I started by using [Simple Token Authentication gem](https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/simple_token_authentication). It served me well until I realized that I need support for multiple tokens per model.

Imagine a following scenario: your API has **two clients** - a web application and a mobile application. User A signs in to the web application and receives a token. Then he signs in to the mobile application and receives the **very same token** (because there is only one token per user). At this point, user A decides to log out from the web application, so we generate a new token for him and the old token becomes invalid. What is the consequence? User A is also logged out of the mobile application!

This is **not a user-friendly behaviour**. We don't want the user to be logged out of all applications, we want him to be logged out of just one application. The solution to this problem is to issue a new token after each successful log in attempt and store **multiple tokens** per each user. This is possible with Tiddle.

### Integration with your app

Installation goes as usual, but I include it here for completeness. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tiddle'
```

And then execute ```bundle install```.

You have to **create model** which holds authentication tokens. You can choose arbitrary model name, but following fields have to be included: ```body```, ```last_used_at```, ```ip_address``` and ```user_agent```. For example, you can generate such a migration:

```
rails g model AuthenticationToken body:string user:references last_used_at:datetime ip_address:string user_agent:string
```

Then you have to specify ```:token_authenticatable``` in the model used for Devise authentication:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :trackable, :validatable,
         :token_authenticatable # here it is

  [...]
end
```

This model should also include **association** called ```authentication_tokens``` (the name is important), so tokens can be looked up and created inside Tiddle.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  [...]

  has_many :authentication_tokens
end
```

The last step is to subclass ```Devise::SessionsController``` as [described in Devise documentation](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#configuring-controllers). In ```create``` action we check the provided email and password. If they are valid, we create a new authentication token and return it in the response. In ```destroy``` action we expire the current token (or do nothing if the user is not authenticated).

```ruby
class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController

  def create
    user = warden.authenticate!(auth_options)
    token = Tiddle.create_and_return_token(user, request)
    render json: { authentication_token: token }
  end

  def destroy
    Tiddle.expire_token(current_user, request) if current_user
    render json: {}
  end

  private

    # this is invoked before destroy and we have to override it
    def verify_signed_out_user
    end
end
```

**And that's it!** If you want to require authenticated user in some controller, just follow the standard Devise way:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user! # nothing fancy

  def index
    render json: Post.all
  end
end
```

Every request to this endpoint has to include ```X-USER-EMAIL``` and ```X-USER-TOKEN``` headers, so the authentication strategy can look up the user by email and then check validity of the token.

You can take a look at the **example Rails application** which I created: https://github.com/adamniedzielski/tiddle-rails-demo

### Usage in AngularJS client

This is a short example of token authentication written in AngularJS. It was tested with Angular 1.4.7. In our client we have to:

* provide the email and password to **obtain** the token
* **save** the email and token in cookies
* **send** the email and token with every request

This is a simplified controller action which makes request to our API:

```javascript
angular.module('app')
  .controller('MainController', function ($scope, $http, $cookies) {
    $scope.user = {};

    $scope.login = function() {
      $http.post('http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in.json', { user: { email: $scope.user.email, password: $scope.user.password } }).
        then(function (response) {
          $cookies.put("user_email", $scope.user.email);
          $cookies.put("user_token", response.data.authentication_token);
        });
    };
  });

```

And this is a **request interceptor** which adds authentication headers to every request:

```javascript
angular.module('app', ['ngCookies']);

angular.module("app").
  config(function($httpProvider) {
    $httpProvider.interceptors.push(function($cookies) {
      return {
        'request': function(config) {
          config.headers['X-USER-EMAIL'] = $cookies.get("user_email");
          config.headers['X-USER-TOKEN'] = $cookies.get("user_token");
          return config;
        }
      };
    });
  });
```

You can get the code of the **complete AngularJS example** here: https://github.com/adamniedzielski/tiddle-angular-demo

### Deleting old tokens

After some time your database may be full of old tokens which are no longer used. They are the result of sign-ins which were never followed by sign-out. Tiddle has it covered - you can invoke ```Tiddle.purge_old_tokens(user)```. You can do it in a Rake task:

```ruby
task purge_old_authentication_tokens: :environment do
  User.find_each do |user|
    Tiddle.purge_old_tokens(user)
  end
end
```

<h3 id="rails-session">
  Note on Rails session
</h3>

Tiddle was built with API-only applications in mind. In API-only application you should **avoid using cookies** at all. The pair of email and token is what identifies the user. However, we rely on Devise ```database_authenticatable``` strategy to perform the sign in action and in this case Devise stores ```user_id``` in Rails session.

This results in an extremely confusing situation: you send **wrong token**, but manage to authenticate. That's because Rails session was sent and Devise performed authentication based on it.

The safest solution in API-only application is not to rely on Rails session at all and **disable** it. Put this line in your ```application.rb```:

```ruby
config.middleware.delete ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore
```

### Conclusion

I hope someone can benefit from Tiddle, that's why I open sourced it. If you find any bugs, please report them at GitHub Issues.
