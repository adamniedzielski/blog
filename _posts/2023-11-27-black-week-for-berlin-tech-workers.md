title: "Black week for Berlin Tech Workers"
---

It's this time of the year again. After people bought a lot of cyber shit, companies start with **firing**. Great gift for Christmas, really. November 2020 Liefery, **November 2023 Marley Spoon**.

In **Germany**:

Only **written** down, **recorded** communication brings anything. Wait for **letters**, do not talk to them on the phone. Companies know how to deliver letters quickly. My letter came when I went outside home for a lunch break. Great timing. The letter may not have any stamp and say **"Per Bote"**. It's not a scam. It means that someone delivered it personally and will be a witness in court if necessary.

**"Aufhebungsvertrag"** means a polite **offer** to resolve the employment contract. **Don't be polite**. They want to keep their money. And definitely **take your time** to consider the offer. I know people that worked with me at Liefery who signed immediately in November, and got one month of severance pay less than people who signed on **December** 1st.

The best money went to the people who **sued the company**. Do you have a **Rechtsschutzversicherung** (insurance to protect from legal costs)? As far as I know you won't be able to join if there's already a situation going on.

Are you in a workers union like for example [Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft ver.di](https://tech.verdi.de/) or **IG Metall**? It doesn't matter which of these two, they both work hand-in-hand in **Berlin** ü§ù. If yes, you're probably not even reading at this point, because you're **calling your union**.

If not, it may be already too late to **join a union**. That said, I've heard about some exceptional offers if **many people join together**. Something like a bulk discount for **Berlin Tech Workers** Week. They are not public, though.

If you think that **joining a union** is political (everything is political, wake up!) and still want to get good money out of it, get an <u>autonom</u>ous **lawyer**. The best deals that got struck when Liefery was closing down back in November 2020 went to people who **sued the company**. I believe that it's even possible to get some **free lawyer consultation**, but I can't say much about it for myself. Instead **I can help** with securing the best offers üòâ.
