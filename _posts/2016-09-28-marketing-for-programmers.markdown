title: "Marketing for programmers"
---

I'm bad at marketing products that I created. Just today I had to shut down Codebase Health Check, because I couldn't get enough customers in the last six months. Apparently it's not so easy to [build a profitable business as a side project](https://abot.app/blog/profitable-slack-bot-rails). Fortunately, you have a chance to be much **better at marketing** than me.

I'm excited to share that my friend Jack Kinsella has published his [book about marketing for programmers](https://www.jackkinsella.ie/books/entreprenerd/marketing_for_programmers). Jack certainly knows what he is talking about - he runs a profitable online business and he did all the marketing. This book is aimed at programmers and Jack is also a self-taught software developer.

What I really hate about other marketing books is that they are theoretical and you don't get any rules which you can immediately apply in practice. "**Entreprenerd: The Busy Person's Primer on SEO, Paid Advertising, and Conversion Optimisation**" is different. It literally consists of real life stories and actionable pointers.

After a couple years of experience building software products, I now strongly believe that only 20% of your success comes from building a great product and the remaining 80% is sales and marketing.

We - programmers - tend to think that if we build a perfect product people will come on their own. But that's not true! They will definitely not come unless you spend your time on reaching out to them. That's why I recommend you to skip learning about the latest JavaScript framework and instead [read this book and get better at marketing](https://www.jackkinsella.ie/books/entreprenerd/marketing_for_programmers).
